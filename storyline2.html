<h1>Hello!</h1>
	<p>It was a pleasure having the oppurtunity to meet you guys last week. I want to show you a work or two of mine <a href="storyline2.html">here</a> today</p>

	<p>I am <strong>Dorjee Wangchuk Gurung</strong> and I am about to graduate with a degree in Software Engineering from Asia Pacific University.</p>
	
	<p>Before I show you my work, Please allow me to introduce more about myself.</p>

	<details>
		<summary>I have an open personality with an eagerness to try out new things. I don't do well in challenges but I do pretty well when I enjoy the things I do.</summary>
		<ul>
			<li>I've been actively using front-end only for a few months, since I have been into back-end previously. Nonetheless, I have a few work of mine here which I built a few days ago.</li>
			<li><a href="home.html">I hope this works!</a></li>
		</ul>

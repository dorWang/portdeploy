	<h1>Work Experience</h1>
	<p>I started using HTML5 and CSS3 around half a year ago. I do not have much experience in front end but I am keen on learning it. I have played around with html, css and javascript before. Although I do not have clear proficiency, I am able handle it to quite a good degree. </p>
	<p>I have been mostly building stand alone systems using Java, C++, and C#. Therefore, there are only a few works I have done related to front-end. You can see two of the works I have carried out related to front end developing below</p>

It is currently running using Azure Cloud Service. It was built using Django Framework 1.9 and Python 2.7. The html and css elements also adopt unique attributes provided by the Visual Studio IDE.
